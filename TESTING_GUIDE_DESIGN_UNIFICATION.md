## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Icons Not Showing
**Symptoms:** Icon boxes appear empty  
**Cause:** Remix Icons not loaded  
**Solution:**

// Verify in index.html or App.js:
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/remixicon@2.5.0/fonts/remixicon.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

### Issue 2: Hover Effects Not Working
**Symptoms:** No animation on hover  
**Cause:** CSS not applied or browser issue  
**Solution:** 
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check DevTools for CSS conflicts
- Verify `.booking-section:hover` exists in CSS

### Issue 3: Border-radius Not Uniform
**Symptoms:** Some cards still have old radius  
**Cause:** CSS specificity or overrides  
**Solution:**
- Inspect element in DevTools
- Check for conflicting CSS rules
- Add `!important` if necessary (last resort)

### Issue 4: Focus Glow Not Visible
**Symptoms:** No orange glow on input focus  
**Cause:** Box-shadow may be overridden  
**Solution:**
```css
input:focus, select:focus {
  outline: none;
  border-color: var(--secondary-color);
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(255,126,1,0.1) !important;
